# Epic Universal React Native App

Welcome to the Epic Universal React Native App! This project is a comprehensive application built with React Native, designed to run seamlessly on both mobile and web platforms. It leverages the power of Expo Router for file-based routing, Tamagui for styling, and Tanstack Query for state management. Get ready to embark on an exciting journey of building a feature-rich app that fetches and displays movie data from the popular movie database API.

## Features

- **File-Based Routing**: This app utilizes Expo Router, a powerful file-based routing system for React Native applications. This approach simplifies navigation and provides a more intuitive way to structure your app's routes and components.

- **Tamagui Styling**: We've incorporated Tamagui, a modern and highly customizable styling library for React Native. Tamagui allows you to create beautiful and consistent user interfaces with ease, leveraging its powerful styling capabilities and extensive component library.

- **Tanstack Query**: State management is a crucial aspect of any application, and we've chosen Tanstack Query to handle it efficiently. Tanstack Query provides a robust and efficient way to fetch, cache, and update asynchronous data, ensuring a smooth and reactive user experience.

- **Movie Database API Integration**: This app seamlessly integrates with the popular movie database API, allowing you to fetch and display movie data, including titles, descriptions, ratings, and more. Get ready to explore a vast collection of movies and create engaging user experiences around them.
- **react-native-mmkv**: The app incorporates react-native-mmkv, a powerful and efficient key-value storage solution, which enables persistent local storage. This feature allows users to favorite movies, enhancing their personalized experience.
